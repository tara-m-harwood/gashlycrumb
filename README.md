## General info

Gashlycrumb Randomly Creepy is a web application that allows users to display one character from the illustrated
alphabet poem "The Gashlycrumb Tines" by Edward Gorey (1965).  Users can generate a character in one
of three ways:
* Randomly -> a character is selected from the database at random
* Alphabetically -> users enter any letter of the alphabet to retrive the associated character
* Perilously -> users choose a hazard from a drop-down menu to retrive the associated character

This app was developed by [Tara Harwood](https://www.linkedin.com/in/taraharwood/) as a student 
project after one month as a Full-Stack Software Engineering student at Flatiron School in Denver, CO.
This is Tara's first full-stack app that she developed entirely independently.  The primary purpose
of the app was for Tara to practice and solidify her new skills, both frontend and backend.  

Any entertainment value it may provide is entirely coincidental.

## Inspiration
From [Amazon.com](https://www.amazon.com/Gashlycrumb-Tinies-Edward-Gorey/dp/0151003084/ref=sr_1_1)
>"A is for Amy who fell down the stairs. B is for Basil assaulted by bears. C is for Clara who wasted away. 
D is for Desmond thrown out of a sleigh..." The rhyming couplets of this grim abecedarian are familiar, 
of course, to devotees of macabre humor, but the darkly crosshatched drawings are (as Poe put it) 
"the soul of the plot."

>"Edward Gorey, known for his unsettling pen-and-ink drawings with a Victorian flair, wrote and illustrated
such books as The Doubtful Guest, The Gashlycrumb Tinies, and The Headless Bust. He was also the illustrator
for the bestselling Lewis Barnavelt series by John Bellairs. Gorey was a very successful set and costume 
designer, earning a Tony Award for his Broadway production of Dracula. His works dating back to the 1950s 
have been collected in the Amphigorey series of books. He died in 2000."
